# Project Title: 
Stock Price Prediction for Netflix using LSTM

# Problem Statement:

The stock market is a dynamic and complex system where investors aim to make informed decisions to maximize their returns. Predicting the stock price of a company like Netflix is particularly challenging due to its exposure to various market dynamics, competition, and global events. This project aims to develop a robust predictive model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast the future stock prices of Netflix accurately.

# Description:

Netflix is a leading streaming service provider, and its stock price is influenced by a myriad of factors, including subscriber growth, content releases, market sentiment, and economic conditions. This project will utilize historical stock price data, along with relevant features such as trading volume, macroeconomic indicators, and news sentiment analysis, to train an LSTM-based deep learning model.

# Conclusion:

Summarize the project's findings and key results. Discuss the model's accuracy and its ability to predict Netflix stock prices. Highlight any challenges encountered during the project and potential areas for improvement. Emphasize the importance of using LSTM neural networks for time series forecasting tasks like stock price prediction.
